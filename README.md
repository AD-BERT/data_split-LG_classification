# Experiments on PubMed Abstracts

1. Split the pubmed abstracts found by the key word: eczema from pubmed central, into abstracts containing the term Atopic Dermatitis (AD).
2. Train a binary classifier that can classify AD and non-AD abstracts. As a pre-processing steps the terms eczema and atopic dermatitis is removed.
  This is to avoid trivial classification.
